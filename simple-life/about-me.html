                    <p class="headings">Finding simplicity in life</p>
            <p>My name is John and living the simple life saved my life </p>

            <p><strong>I used to be a pack rat.</strong>  I had so many things that I thought 
                that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any 
                of it because there was too much. 
            </p>    
               <p> Things were terrible. I had a 
                job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I 
                couldn't hold a relationship. 
                </p>
               <p> How I turned things around  </p>

                <p><strong> I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</strong> I literally 
                put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved 
                into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job. 
                </p>
                
                <p> It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what 
                else to do. And it worked. </p>
                
                <p> Now I live the simple life </p>
                
               <p> Now that I'm living 
                a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life 
                and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy. 
                </p>
                
                <p> With how much it turned my life around,<strong> I felt like I had no choice but to 
                    start sharing how I did it,</strong> and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I 
                started this site! </p>
