                    There are many ways to simplify your life, <span class="simple">a few of which we've 
                        explored in the past</span> . This week we're taking a bit of a approach 
                    though, in how you can find simplicity in the life you already 
                    living. </p></div>

                    <p> Food is a very important part of everyone's life. If you want 
                        to be healthy, you have to eat healthy. One of the easiest ways 
                        to do that is to keep your cooking nice and simple. </p>

                    <p class="headings">Simplicity and work</p>
                    <p> Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it 
                        ruins their relationship with others and it leads to burnout. By 
                        keeping your work life as simple as possible, it will help balance 
                        everything out. </p>

                    <p> A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either 
                        don't decorate, or they go overboard and it doesn't have the impact 
                        they were hoping for. Staying simple will help draw the eye where you 
                        want it to and make things pop like never before. </p>
