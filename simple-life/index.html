            <p><strong class="main-top">Life can get complicated really quickly</strong> , but it doesn't have to be!

                <p> Food is a very important part of everyone's life. If you want 
                    to be healthy, you have to eat healthy. One of the easiest ways 
                    to do that is to keep your cooking nice and simple. </p>

                <p class="headings">Simplicity and work</p>
                <p> Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it 
                    ruins their relationship with others and it leads to burnout. By 
                    keeping your work life as simple as possible, it will help balance 
                    everything out. </p>

                <p class="headings">Simple decorations</p>
                <p> A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either 
                    don't decorate, or they go overboard and it doesn't have the impact 
                    they were hoping for. Staying simple will help draw the eye where you 
                    want it to and make things pop like never before. </p>
